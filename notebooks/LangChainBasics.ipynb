Sauvignon Blanc: This white wine has crisp acidity and herbaceous flavors that pair well with the lightness of steamed fish. Look for one from New Zealand or the Loire Valley in France.\\n\\n2. Chardonnay: Choose an unoaked or lightly oaked Chardonnay to avoid overwhelming the fish. The wine's fruity and citrusy notes can enhance the flavors of the dish.\\n\\n3. Pinot Grigio/Pinot Gris: This white wine has a clean and refreshing character that pairs nicely with steamed fish. It offers subtle flavors of apple, pear, and citrus, which can complement the dish.\\n\\n4. Riesling: If you prefer a touch of sweetness, an off-dry Riesling can be an excellent pairing. Its acidity and fruity notes balance well with the fish's flavors.\\n\\nRemember, personal taste plays a significant role in wine pairing.
