"
The user is part of a team working on a machine learning project and they use W&B for model training and evaluation. They have generated some reports about the training progress and performance of their models. Now, they want to share those reports with their teammates for collaborative analysis and suggestions. The user is a bit confused about who can edit these shared reports and is wondering whether the collaborators can make changes to their original reports.
","
Can my teammates edit the reports that I share with them from my W&B account? Or will they only have view access to the reports?
","
Reports that you share are view-only. If these reports are created within a team project, both you (as the creator) and other team administrators can toggle permissions between edit or view access for the team members. So if you specifically allow, other team members can edit the shared reports. For shared individual projects, only you can see the reports. When you share a report, the invited users via email will need to log in to W&B to view the report, but if you provide a magic link, the recipients won't need to log into W&B to view the report."
"
The user has written their first report on W&B and wants to share it with their team for collaborative editing and feedback. However, they are unsure about how to share the report and who can edit it. 
","
I just finished my report, how can I share it with my team for editing? And who among my team can edit the report?
","
Once you have saved a report, you can easily share it by selecting the **Share** button on the upper right hand corner. You can either provide an email account or copy a link, known as the magic link, which would grant access to your report.

Concerning editing, if the report is created within a team project, both the administrator or the member who created the report can toggle permissions between edit or view access for other team members. However, please note that shared reports are view-only by default."
"
A user has just created a W&B report within their private project and now they want to share this report with a few specific team members. However, they are unsure about the steps they need to follow to do this, and they aren't sure if the team members need an account to access the report.
","
Hi, I've created a report in my private project. Can I share it with specific people in my team? And do they need a W&B account to view it?
","
Yes, you can share your report with specific members of your team. To do this, select the **Share** button on the upper right hand corner of the report. You can either provide their email accounts or copy the magic link. If you choose to invite them by entering their email address, they will need to log into Weights & Biases to view the report. However, if you give them the magic link, they do not need to log into Weights & Biases to view the report. Take note, shared reports are view-only."
"The user has just created a report in W&B and they want to share it with their team for collaboration. They are unsure of how to perform this action, and have some specific queries around privacy settings and collaborative editing.
","How can I share my W&B reports with my team and allow them to edit as well? Also, is there a way to resolve if there's an edit conflict?
","
Absolutely, you can indeed share your W&B reports with your team. The ""Share"" button on the upper right-hand corner of your report serves this purpose. If you want to allow your team members to edit your report, it should be noted that on team projects, both the administrator, or member who created the report, can toggle permissions between edit or view access for other team members.

In regards to edit conflicts - if you and a team member happen to edit the same report simultaneously, a warning notification will appear to guide you in resolving the potential conflict.

Remember, the drafts of your reports auto-save, and you can always ""Save to Report"" to publish your changes to the shared report.
"
"
The user has created a report within W&B and now wants to collaborate with others on it. They are curious about how to share the report and then allow others to edit it and if there are any conflicts during collaboration, how they'd be resolved. They don't know whether they should provide edit or view-only access, and also they are interested in knowing who can edit reports.
","
How can I shared the report I created with my team? Can they edit it and what happens if more than one person edits it at the same time? Can I comment on some specific part of the report?
","
Yes, you can share your W&B reports with your team. 

To share a report, select the `Share` button on the upper right hand corner. You can either provide an email account or copy the magic link. If you share by email, the user will need to log into Weights & Biases to view the report. If you share using the magic link, the user doesn't need to log into Weights & Biases.

For team projects, both the administrator and the member who created the report can toggle permissions between edit or view access for other team members. Shared reports are view-only by default.

If an edit conflict occurs, for instance if more than one person tries to edit the same report at the same time, you'll see a warning notification that will guide you to resolve the potential conflicts.

Additionally, you can click the comment button on a panel in a report to add a comment directly to that panel, allowing more specific discussions on different parts of a report."

The user is trying to manage experiments with multiple datasets, which can be considerably challenging. They want to know how to use Weights & Biases for this purpose and ensure their experiments are organized and easily reproducible. 
","
I am working with multiple datasets for pre-training and fine-tuning. How do I manage and organize these different datasets using Weights & Biases? 
","
Using Weights & Biases you can save a different artifact for each data source. Here’s a sample code to do that

```
run = wandb.init(job_type=""dataset-creation"")
artifact = wandb.Artifact('nature-dataset', type='dataset')
artifact.add_dir(""nature-data"")
run.log_artifact(artifact)
```

You can run this code for each of your datasets. This will allow you to keep your experiments organized and easily reproducible. 

Artifacts let you see and formalize the flow of data through your model development scripts. This includes preprocessing, training, testing, analysis, and any other job type. 

You can further explore the interactive graph of your data [here](https://wandb.ai/stacey/mendeleev/artifacts/balanced\_data/inat\_80-10-10\_5K/ab79f01e007113280018/graph). The graph allows you to visualize your data workflow and easily share it with others."
"
The user is training a machine learning model using the Weights & Biases platform. To facilitate efficient training, they've decided to implement a more complex curriculum. They want to start with pre-training on subsets of classes from ImageNet, and subsequently fine-tune the model using specialized datasets like iNaturalist or their own unique photo collection. They're aware that this type of workflow could involve managing and keeping track of several data artifacts, and they're looking for a way to simplify and streamline this process.
","
In my training process, I'm using various datasets. How can I use W&B to manage different artifacts effectively for easy reproduction of experiments?
","
With W&B, you can save a distinct artifact for each data type or source to keep your experiments organized and more easily reproducible. To handle multiple datasets, you use the `wandb.Artifact()` function to create new artifacts for each dataset. You give them names (e.g., 'nature-dataset'), tag them as 'dataset' types, specify a directory, and then log each artifact like so: 

```python
run = wandb.init(job_type=""dataset-creation"")
artifact = wandb.Artifact('nature-dataset', type='dataset')
artifact.add_dir(""nature-data"")
run.log_artifact(artifact)
```

Doing this allows Weights & Biases to automatically track changes to your datasets and creates new versions when changes are made. This feature greatly simplifies juggling multiple datasets and helps ensure that your experiments can be accurately replicated.

For a more graphical understanding of your data workflow, you can visualize your artifacts as a directed graph using the W&B interface.
Please refer to your W&B dashboard or this link to explore interactively: [Explore the graph interactively →](https://wandb.ai/stacey/mendeleev/artifacts/balanced\_data/inat\_80-10-10\_5K/ab79f01e007113280018/graph)"

A user is working with complex machine learning tasks and is making the transition from pre-training on one dataset to fine-tuning on a custom dataset. As there is a lot of data involved, and they all come from unique sources, organizing these datasets for convenient access and uses becomes a priority. 
","
I'm pre-training on ImageNet classes and then fine-tuning on a custom dataset. This process has become quite messy. Is there a way to handle multiple datasets efficiently in W&B?
","
Yes, you can efficiently handle multiple datasets in Weights & Biases. In tasks that require complex curriculums like domain adaptation, transfer learning, and meta-learning, you can save an artifact for each data type or source. This method keeps your experiments organized and easily reproducible. Here's an example of how to do this:

```python
# This is how you can initialize a run and create an Artifact
run = wandb.init(job_type=""dataset-creation"")
artifact = wandb.Artifact('your-dataset-name', type='dataset')
artifact.add_dir(""your-dataset-folder"")

# Log the artifact. Now, you have a new version of the artifact tracked in W&B.
run.log_artifact(artifact)
```
In this example, replace 'your-dataset-name' and 'your-dataset-folder' with your actual dataset name and folder. By doing this for each unique data type or source, you can juggle multiple datasets conveniently. 

You can also visualize your experiments interactively in W&B with Artifacts graph. It provides you with a holistic view of your dataset-versioning and model-building process. 

But remember, if nothing changes in your artifact, W&B doesn't re-upload any data or create a new version. For a new version to be created and tracked, there should be a change in the tracked files in the artifact."
"
The user is working on a machine learning project which involves multiple datasets. They are at the stage where they are trying to manage these datasets in their work pipeline -- preprocessing, training, testing, and analysis. They are looking specifically at how to track changes in their datasets using Weights and Biases.
","
I'm using multiple datasets for my model training and testing, all varying in size and sometimes content. How can I efficiently manage these datasets and keep track of their versions? Also, can I annotate them to remember what each one is for?
","
Yes, you can do this by using W&B's Artifacts. They provide a way to manage and keep track of versions of your datasets efficiently. Here is how you would do it:

```python
# Initialize a new wandb run
run = wandb.init(job_type=""dataset-creation"")

# Create an artifact for this run, here 'nature-dataset' is the custom name of the artifact
artifact = wandb.Artifact('nature-dataset', type='dataset')

# Add the dataset directory to it
artifact.add_dir(""nature-data"")

# Log the artifact into your run 
run.log_artifact(artifact)
```

In this code, any changes in your datasets will be captured and a new version will be created. You don't have to manually upload the dataset -- if the dataset does not change, it will not re-upload any data. You can also annotate your datasets with custom names (like 'nature-dataset' above) and add notes or key-value pair metadata to them.

For juggling with multiple datasets, you can save a different artifact for each data type or source to keep your experiments organized. This will also make your experiments easily reproducible.

In addition, Artifacts also allow you to visualize and easily share your data workflow.

![](/images/data_model_versioning/juggle_multiple_datasets_2.png)

This way, you can track the flow of data through your model development scripts - whether for preprocessing, training, testing, analysis, or any other job type."
"
A user is constructing a complex training pipeline involving various datasets. They're planning to pre-train their model on one dataset and possibly fine-tune it using another custom dataset. This process could involve multiple rounds of data manipulation where updates and changes are made to respective datasets for each stage. The user is unsure of how to track, organize and visualize these manipulations, versions and workflows in Weights & Biases (W&B).
","
Hey, I'm working with multiple versions of data and I keep making updates to it for different training stages. It's a mess! How can I better track and visualize these versions and workflows within Weights & Biases? 
","
W&B provides a feature called Artifacts to help you manage your datasets. You can create an artifact for each type of data or source. Each time you make an update to an artifact (dataset), W&B will automatically create a new version of it. Here's how you can do it:

```python
run = wandb.init(job_type=""dataset-creation"")
artifact = wandb.Artifact('nature-dataset', type='dataset')
artifact.add_dir(""nature-data"")
# Edit the list of ids in one of your files, say 'animal-ids.txt'.
# On logging the artifact, W&B will identify the changed file
run.log_artifact(artifact)
# Now you have a new version of the artifact, tracked in W&B
```

This way, you can track different versions of your datasets and changes made to them. You can also visualize and easily share your data workflow within W&B by exploring the Artifacts graphs interactively. You can see formalized flow of data through your preprocessing, training, testing or analysis scripts.

"The user is trying to log the training code of a machine learning model to Weights & Biases as an Artifact.
","How can I log my code as an artifact on Weights & Biases while using the python file `train.py`?
","In order to log your code as an artifact in Weights & Biases, you need to make use of wandb's `run.log_code()` function inside the `wandb.init()` context. An example as per the provided code is represented below:

```python
def train_fmnist(config):
    with wandb.init(project=""launch-quickstart"", config=config):
        wandb.run.log_code()
        ...
```
This particular piece of code logs `train.py` (or whichever code file is currently executing) to Weights & Biases as an Artifact. It’s easy to get to the executed script, and it helps in future in case you need to understand what code was executed in a particular run.
"
"
The user is working with the PyTorch framework and has just copied the provided Python code to their local machine to train a simple Convolutional Neural Network on the FashionMNIST dataset. They notice in the code that the user config parameters are passed to the `wandb.init()` function, and they are wondering how they can modify these and what can be included in the config.
","
Hi, I am using your sample PyTorch code for the FashionMNIST dataset. I see a `config` parameter that's being passed into `wandb.init()`. Can you explain more about this config and how can I customize it?
","
Yes, you're on the right track. The `wandb.init()` function takes `config` as an argument -- this is a dict-like object to set and save all your hyperparameters. You can put any key-value pairs in your `config` object relating to your model's configuration, including learning rates, batch sizes, number of epochs, etc. 

The code snippet:
```python
def train_fmnist(config):
    # Pass config into wandb.init
    with wandb.init(project=""launch-quickstart"", config=config):
        # ...
```
indicates initializing the W&B run with the `wandb.init()` function by passing the `config` object. You can adjust the config parameters to your liking before you pass them in your `wandb.init()` routine.

Here's how you can modify it:
```python
config = {
    ""learning_rate"": 0.01,
    ""batch_size"": 64,
    ""epochs"": 10,
    # you can add any key-value pairs that are related to your model's hyperparameters
}
```
And pass this `config` when calling `train_fmnist` function.

Keep in mind, this `config` object will be logged and versioned with your experiment run automatically, making it easy to keep track of what hyperparameters you used in your experiments.

The user is trying to set up a training project using Weights & Biases with a Tensorflow dataset. They have successfully integrated the Weights & Biases (W&B) library into their training script and want to understand how to log their code as an artifact using the W&B platform. They are interested in replicability and traceability of their training runs and are looking to apply the best practices offered by W&B.
","

I'm setting up my project with Weights and Biases and I noticed somewhere that I can log my training code as an artifact. How do I go about it using W&B in the context of a PyTorch training script like the one I am working with? 
","

Yes, you can log your code as an artifact using Weights & Biases to ensure traceability of your training runs. This can be achieved by adding the `wandb.run.log_code()` function call in your script as shown in the example code provided in the document:

```
def train_fmnist(config):
    # Pass config into wandb.init
    with wandb.init(project=""launch-quickstart"", config=config):
        
        # Log training code to W&B as an Artifact.
        wandb.run.log_code()
        ...
```
Here, `wandb.run.log_code()` logs the file that is currently running. You'd use this method right after initializing your W&B run with `wandb.init()`. This way, the version of the code you are running gets saved as an 'Artifact' associated with this run, which you can later refer to."
"The user is trying to modify a simple CNN model for FashionMNIST dataset for use in their project. They have several ML models and they want to keep track of their code versions for reproducibility. They have come across an option in Weights and Biases to log their code as an Artifact but are not sure how to do it within their training function.
","How can I log my model's training code as an Artifact in W&B?
","You can use the `wandb.run.log_code()` function in your training function to log your training code as an Artifact in Weights and Biases. Below is a snippet showing it:

```python
def train_fmnist(config):

    with wandb.init(project=""launch-quickstart"", config=config):
        
        # Log training code to W&B as an Artifact.
        wandb.run.log_code()

        ...

In the above code, the `wandb.run.log_code()` command logs the code of the training script to Weights and Biases. This allows you to keep track of changes you've made to your model or data processing code across runs of your experiment."
"The user is working on a Fashion MNIST classification model using PyTorch and wants to use Weights & Biases for experiment tracking.

```

As peeked from the documentation, you first initialize the wandb run with wandb.init(), and then you can log the code for your training script with wandb.run.log_code(). This method logs the code file from which it was called as an artifact to your run in W&B. Make sure to call this method within the context of your wandb run."

The user is setting up a PyTorch based project and trying to implement distributed learning using the PyTorch Lightning framework. They are also using Weights and Biases for tracking and logging their model training and would like to integrate W&B logger with PyTorch Lightning's Trainer. The user isn't sure how to properly setup W&B with PyTorch Lightning's Trainer and whether it's possible to monitor various metrics (like loss) using W&B in this specific framework. 
","
Hi there! I am trying to implement distributed training using PyTorch Lightning and want to use Weights & Biases for tracking my training. Can I log my loss metrics to W&B directly from my PyTorch Lightning's training step function? Also, how to connect W&B logger with Lightning's Trainer?
","
Yes, you can indeed log your training or validation loss directly to your W&B dashboard from PyTorch Lightning's step functions. Inside your step function, you can use the `self.log(""<indicator_name>"", <value>)` method to log any metrics you're interested in. For example, in your `training_step` or `validation_step` method, you would use `self.log(""train/loss"", loss)` or `self.log(""val/loss"", loss)` to log the operation's loss.

As for integrating W&B with the `Trainer` in PyTorch Lightning, you will need to use the `WandbLogger` provided by the `pytorch_lightning.loggers`. Here's how you would do it:

```python
wandb_logger = WandbLogger(project = ""<your_project_name>"")
trainer = pl.Trainer(
        max_epochs = 3, 
        gpus = 2,
        logger = wandb_logger, # Pass the W&B logger to your trainer
        strategy=""ddp"", 
        callbacks=callbacks
    )
```
This will allow you to utilize all features of W&B including tracking, logging and visualization, directly within your PyTorch Lightning training iteration."
"
The user is new to Weights & Biases integration with PyTorch Lightning. He/She has built a model using the PyTorch library and now wants to train the model using Weights & Biases trainer. Specifically, the user is interested in understanding how to use the trainer for distributed training on multiple GPUs. 
","
Hi, I am working on a model built with PyTorch. I want to use Weights & Biases for training my model, but I'm not clear on how to set up training for multiple GPUs. Can you guide me through this?
","
Sure. Using W&B with PyTorch Lightning is quite straightforward. For distributed training on multiple GPUs, you will setup the trainer as shown in the following snippet:

```python
trainer = pl.Trainer(
    max_epochs = 3, 
    gpus = 2, 
    logger = wandb_logger, 
    strategy=""ddp"", 
    callbacks=callbacks
)
```
In the `pl.Trainer`, 
- `max_epochs = 3`: sets the number of total epochs for which the model will be trained.
- `gpus = 2`: represents the number of GPUs you want to use for training the model.
- `logger = wandb_logger`: the instance of `WandbLogger`, this is required to log the metric and model parameters to W&B dashboard.
- `strategy=""ddp""`: is the distributed strategy. Here ""ddp"" stands for DistributedDataParallel which is the strategy you want for distributed training on multiple GPUs.
- `callbacks=callbacks`: any extra functions you want to call at a specific stage of training.

And then call the `fit()` method of the trainer with parameters including your model and data loaders like this:
```python 
trainer.fit(model, train_loader, val_loader)
```
This will start the training of your model on multiple GPUs.
"
"
The user is attempting to use Weights & Biases with PyTorch's LightningModule for training an MNIST Classifier. They have seen that `self.log` is being used for logging the training and validation losses, but they are not sure how this integrates with W&B.
","
How can I log my training and validation loss with Weights & Biases when using PyTorch Lightning?
","
Yes, you can use Weights & Biases with PyTorch Lightning to log your training and validation losses. The key is to use `self.log` in your `training_step` and `validation_step` methods. In the provided script, the logged losses are named as ""train/loss"" and ""val/loss"". These will automatically be logged to your W&B dashboard.

To connect PyTorch Lightning with W&B, create a WandbLogger:

```python
wandb_logger = WandbLogger(project = ""<project_name>"")
```

Then, pass this logger to the Trainer:

```python
trainer = pl.Trainer(
        max_epochs = 3, 
        gpus = 2, 
        logger = wandb_logger, 
        strategy=""ddp"", 
        callbacks=callbacks
    )
```

The WandbLogger interacts with the PyTorch Lightning's `self.log` method to report all your important metrics to W&B."
"The user is working on an MNIST Classifier model using PyTorch Lightning and is looking to log the training and validation loss with Weights & Biases. They are also curious about how to use ModelCheckpoint and training with multiple GPUs on Weights & Biases.
","How can I integrate W&B into my PyTorch Lightning code for training an MNIST Classifier model and log the training and validation losses? Also, how can I use W&B for model checkpoint and training on multiple GPUs?

Sure! Here's an example of how to integrate Weights & Biases with your PyTorch Lightning code using an MNIST Classifier model and how to log training and validation losses:

```python
from pytorch_lightning.loggers import WandbLogger
from pytorch_lightning.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint

class MNISTClassifier(pl.LightningModule):
    ...
    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x, y = batch
        y_hat = self.forward(x)
        loss = self.loss(y_hat, y)
        
        # Log training loss to W&B
        self.log(""train/loss"", loss)
        return {""train_loss"": loss}
    
    def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x, y = batch
        y_hat = self.forward(x)
        loss = self.loss(y_hat, y)
        
        # Log validation loss to W&B
        self.log(""val/loss"", loss)
        return {""val_loss"": loss}

wandb_logger = WandbLogger(project = ""<project_name>"")

# Use W&B for model checkpoint
callbacks = [
        ModelCheckpoint(
            dirpath = ""checkpoints"",
            every_n_train_steps=100,
        ),
    ]

# Use W&B for training on multiple GPUs
trainer = pl.Trainer(
        max_epochs = 3, 
        gpus = 2, 
        logger = wandb_logger, 
        strategy=""ddp"", # Distributed Data Parallel
        callbacks=callbacks
    ) 
trainer.fit(model, train_loader, val_loader)
```
While using Weights & Biases for model checkpoint, the checkpoints will be saved in the provided directory every 100 training steps. Also, to run your training on multiple GPUs using W&B logger, specify the number of GPUs and set the strategy to ""ddp"" for Distributed Data Parallel. Remember that the project name in WandbLogger should be replaced by yours."
"
The user is trying to use Weights & Biases with PyTorch Lightning for the MNIST Classifier model. They are using a multi-GPU system, and they want to ensure that the training is working correctly across all GPUs. They are also logging their training and validation losses and are curious about how they can review their logged data within the Weights & Biases dashboard.
","
How can I use the Weights & Biases logger with PyTorch Lightning's trainer to monitor my model training? And how can I see the logged training losses in Weights & Biases?
","
For logging in W&B, you can use the WandbLogger provided by Weights & Biases. In your main function, you'll need to define this logger and pass it to the PyTorch Lightning's Trainer.

Here's a line from the example where it's done:
```python
wandb_logger = WandbLogger(project = ""<project_name>"")
```
This logger is then passed to the `Trainer` when you initialize it:
```python
trainer = pl.Trainer(
        max_epochs = 3, 
        gpus = 2, 
        logger = wandb_logger, 
        strategy=""ddp"", 
        callbacks=callbacks
) 
```
For monitoring your model training, every time your model goes through a training or a validation step, it logs the loss:
```python
# In training step
self.log(""train/loss"", loss)

# In validation step
self.log(""val/loss"", loss)
```
When you run this code, your program will automatically log these losses to your W&B project that you specified when initializing WandbLogger. You can then access these logs in the Weights & Biases interface, just go to the project page for the project you're logging to. You'll find charts that track these values over time on the dashboard."
"
The user has trained a machine learning model and saved it on Weights & Biases. They have saved various versions of the model while training by periodically saving checkpoints. Now, they want to understand more about what constitutes a ""Model Artifact"" and how it is different from a ""Registered Model"". They are also confused about the aliasing of versions in a Model Artifact.
","
What exactly is a 'Model Artifact' and how is it different from 'Registered Model'? Also, can you elaborate on what you mean when you say that a Model Artifact can alias specific versions?
","
In W&B, a *Model Artifact* represents a series of versions of a trained model. All these versions are logged and tracked, often reflecting the progress during model training. Every individual model being trained by the Run becomes its own Model Artifact, and each checkpoint (saved periodically during training) is a distinct Model Version of that Model Artifact.

An Artifact can **alias** specific versions. This means you can create a reference or shortcut to specific model versions, to easily access them, like pinning at specific checkpoints of your model's training.

On the other hand, a *Registered Model* is more like a curated selection of annotated or linked Model Versions. Imagine it as a set of bookmarks where each bookmark points towards a specific Model Version of a certain Model Artifact.  

Despite Model Versions always belong to one and only one Model Artifact, they can be linked to any number of Registered Models. Typically, for each modeling use case or task, you would create a Registered Model.

Hope this clears up the difference between a Model Artifact and a Registered Model in the context of W&B and clarifies the concept of aliasing in Model Artifacts."

A user has been training various models for different tasks using W&B. They have been saving these models at various checkpoints during the training process to track the progress and improvements. The user is now unsure on how to organize these different versions and wants to understand the difference between Model Version, Model Artifact, and Registered Model. They are also unsure how to store these models effectively.
","
What is the difference between a Model Version, a Model Artifact, and a Registered Model? And how should I be storing these during my model training?
","
In W&B, a **Model Version** refers to an immutable directory of data where you store files pertaining to your model, like architecture and learned parameters. The file formats and what can be stored is up to you, typically, files produced from the serialization process of your modeling library are stored here.

A **Model Artifact** is a sequence of these Model Versions, it helps in tracking the progress of your model training. You can alias specific Model Versions within an Artifact and each instance of a model trained by a Run can correspond to its own Model Artifact.

Lastly, a **Registered Model** is a set of links to the Model Versions. It functions like a collection of ""bookmarks"", where each ""version"" of a Registered Model actually links to a Model Version that belongs to a Model Artifact of the same type. One can create a Registered Model for each use case or modeling task.

To sum, the training versions of your model are stored as Model Versions, collections of these versions (like during training checkpoints) become Model Artifacts and linking these for use cases forms a Registered Model."
"
The user is trying to understand the difference between Model Artifact, Model Version and Registered Model within the context of W&B. They want to organize their model versions but are unclear on best practices for tracking the progress of their training and how to implement it. 
","
Can you explain what's the difference between a Model Artifact, Model Version, and a Registered Model in W&B? How do I select which to use when I want to store my model architecture and its parameters?
","
Absolutely, let's explain each of these terms:

- A **Model Artifact** in Weights & Biases is a sequence of Model Versions. It's used to track the progress of your training. For example, if you are training a model and periodically saving checkpoints, each checkpoint would be a Model Version within the corresponding Model Artifact. It is common to have a Model Artifact for each individual model being trained.

- A **Model Version** is an immutable directory of model data that belongs to one and only one Model Artifact. The data it stores typically includes the model architecture and the learned parameters. These are stored in whatever format your modeling library (like PyTorch or Keras) uses for serialization. 

- Finally, a **Registered Model** acts like a folder of ""bookmarks"", linking to various Model Versions. A Model Version that is part of a Model Artifact can be linked to any number of Registered Models. You would typically create a Registered Model for each of your different use cases or modeling tasks, linking it to the appropriate Model Versions.

To decide which to use when you want to store your model and its parameters, consider your use case. You'd probably use a Model Version for each checkpoint if you're saving those. Then, the sequence of these versions builds up your Model Artifact. And for organizing Model Versions across different tasks or use cases, you'd create a Registered Model."
"The user has been working with weights and biases for a while and using it to track the performance of their machine learning models. Recently, they started exploring more advanced features of W&B like model versioning, artifact management, and are trying to organize their models by use cases. They understood the concepts but are confused about the hierarchies and relations between a Model Version, Model Artifact and a Registered Model.
","Hi, I have some confusion regarding models in W&B. Can you clarify what is a model version, model artifact, and a registered model in W&B and how they are related?
","
Sure. 

In W&B:

1. **Model Version** is an immutable directory of data concerning your model, which includes all the data files & formats you deem appropriate to store your model architecture & learned parameters. You usually want to store files produced from your modeling library's serialization process.

2. **Model Artifact** is a series of Model Versions which tracks the progress of a model during training, often by periodically saving checkpoints. Every time a model checkpoint is saved during training, a new Model Version of the respective Model Artifact is created. Each Model Artifact is exactly an Artifact with `type=""model""` in W&B.

3. **Registered Model** is essentially an Artifact Collection of 'type=""model""', and acts more like a folder of ""bookmarks"". Each version of a Registered Model is actually a link to a Model Version in a Model Artifact. Typically, you'd make a Registered Model for each of your use-cases or modeling tasks.

Importantly:

- A Model Version will always belong to one and only one Model Artifact, but may belong to zero or more Registered Models.
- A Model Artifact is a sequence of Model Versions, it holds the model's training progress.
- A Registered Model is a collection of links to Model Versions. It can be accessed like Model Artifacts but works more like a folder of ""bookmarks"".

I hope this helps clarify the relationships and hierarchies between these concepts!"
"A user is trying to understand the concepts in the W&B documentation related to managing models. They are currently iterating through different versions of their trained models and want to make sure they are correctly storing and accessing different versions of their models.
","I’m a little confused about Model Version, Model Artifact, and Registered Model. What are they exactly, and how do I use them to store and manage different versions of my models during my project?
","
In W&B:

1. **Model Version** is an immutable directory of data that contains all the necessary information about a specific version of your model. It's created everytime you train and save a model. This typically includes the model architecture and learned parameters.

2. **Model Artifact** is essentially a collection of all Model Versions created during your project. This allows you to track the progress of your training by periodically saving checkpoints. Each individual Model Artifact corresponds to an individual model trained in your project and each checkpoint is its own Model Version of the respective Model Artifact.

3. A **Registered Model** is like a set of bookmarks or references to specific Model Versions which you deem significant. It behaves similarly to Model Artifacts but each version of a Registered Model is actually a link to a Model Version. It's common practice to create a Registered Model for each unique use case or modeling task in your project.

You can think of these concepts in terms of Artifacts, where a Model is an Artifact with `type=""model""`, a Model Version corresponds to an Artifact Version and the Registered Model is essentially an Artifact Collection of `type=""model""`. 

This hierarchical structure gives you flexible and controlled access to different versions of your models, allowing you to track their progression over time and revert back to previously saved versions if needed."

The user has just started with Weights and Biases (W&B) and is excited to experiment with hyperparameter optimization using W&B sweeps. However, they note that their W&B Run and W&B Sweep might be in different projects inadvertently. This has caused a confusion in getting their sweep to function properly. Considering the user has not read the documentation fully, their question arises from this confusion.
","
I started using W&B for optimizing my model's hyperparameters. But my W&B Sweep does not seem to sync with my W&B Run. I suspect they maybe in different projects. Does that matter and if yes, how can I make sure they are in the same project?
","

Yes, it's important to ensure that your W&B Run and your W&B Sweep are in the same project. Both the W&B Run and the Sweep must be in the same project for them to synchronize properly.

Here's how you can make sure of that:

When initializing your W&B Run and your W&B Sweep, make sure to provide the same project name.

For instance, while defining your training function and initializing your W&B Run, your code may look like this:

```python
def main():
    wandb.init(project='my-first-sweep') # Provide project name here
    # ... rest of your code ..
```

And while starting your sweep, ensure to provide the same project name:

```python
sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep=sweep_configuration, project='my-first-sweep') # Same project name
# ... rest of your code ..
```

This ensures both your W&B Run and Sweep are in the same project, enabling them to communicate and synchronize properly."
"
The user is trying to set up a W&B Sweep and has chosen the name of a project where he/she would like to output the W&B Run. However, the user is unsure about the name matching case between the W&B Run project and the Sweep project.
","
Do I need to make sure there's a match between the names of the project where I put my W&B run and my W&B Sweep? If I name one ""TestProject"" and the other ""testproject"", will it still work?
","
Yes, you definitely need to make sure there's a match between the names of the project you put your W&B run and your W&B Sweep. According to the W&B documentation, if you choose a name for your W&B Run project, it must match the name of the project you provide when you initialize a W&B Sweep if they're intended to be in the same project. The matching name is necessary because both the W&B Sweep and the W&B Run must be in the same project. So, in your case, ""TestProject"" and ""testproject"" would not match due to the difference in case. Make sure to use the exact same case and spelling for both to avoid errors."
"
The user is familiar with running basic logging commands in Weights & Biases but is trying to run more advanced workflows using sweeps. They've familiarized themselves with the concept and how to set up a basic sweep but they're running into an error. The sweep is ending immediately without running the specified function and throwing an error message saying the project specified in wandb.init() does not match in wandb.sweep().
","
Why do I get an error message that my project specified in wandb.init() and wandb.sweep() does not match, even though I've given the same project name in both? My sweep also terminates instantly.
","
It's crucial that the name of the project you provide when you initialize Weights & Biases (W&B) matches exactly with the name of the project you provide when you initialize a W&B Sweep. This is due to both the W&B Sweep and the W&B Run needing to be in the same project. If there's a mismatch, you may encounter an error.

Check that you've passed the same project name in `wandb.init(project='my-first-sweep')` and `wandb.sweep(sweep=sweep_configuration, project='my-first-sweep')`. If they're not identical, correct this and try running the sweep again.

```python
def main():
    wandb.init(project='my-first-sweep')
    score = objective(wandb.config)
    wandb.log({'score': score})

# Initialize the sweep
sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep=sweep_configuration, project='my-first-sweep')
wandb.agent(sweep_id, function=main, count=10)
```

If the project names do match and you're still facing issues, there might be something else going wrong and you might want to check for other discrepancies in your code.
"
"
A user has just started experimenting with Weights & Biases and is trying to set up their first sweep. They have defined their objective function and started initializing the sweep. However, they forgot to specify the project name in the `wandb.init()` function and is now confused as to why their run is being marked as ""Uncategorized"".
","
I'm trying to set up a sweep on W&B, but I can't seem to find it under my project. Instead, it's being listed as Uncategorized. Did I miss a setup step?
","
Yes, you need to provide the project name when initiating the Weights & Biases run. This is done using the `wandb.init()` function with the project parameter. 

Here's an example:
```python
wandb.init(project='my-first-sweep')
```

If the project name is not specified, the run will be placed in the ""Uncategorized"" project. It's crucial to remember that both the W&B Sweep and W&B Run must be in the same project. So, the name you provide when initializing W&B must match the name of the project you provide when initializing a W&B Sweep."
"
A user has just begun using W&B for their project and wants to start a sweep. They have their training code set up, but they're unsure about how to specify a project name when initializing the sweep and why it's necessary.
","
Why do I need to specify the same project name when setting up my run and sweep in Weights & Biases? And can you show me how to do that?
","
Specifying the project name while setting up your run and sweep is important because both the W&B Run and W&B Sweep must be in the same project. This is to ensure that your run, which logs the output of your model, and your sweep, which handles the hyperparameter tuning, are all aligned within the same project, for easy tracking and reference.

Here's how you do it:

When defining your training function, you initialize your W&B run by specifying the project name like this:

```python
def main():
    wandb.init(project='my-first-sweep')  # Here project is set as 'my-first-sweep'
    score = objective(wandb.config)
    wandb.log({'score': score})
```

Then, when you initialize your W&B Sweep, provide the same project name as you did when initializing your W&B run:

```python
# Start the sweep
sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep=sweep_configuration, project='my-first-sweep')  # Use the same project name here
wandb.agent(sweep_id, function=main, count=10)
```

So in both cases, the project name is 'my-first-sweep'. If a project name is not specified, the run will end up in an 'Uncategorized' project."

The user is working on a machine learning project using Weights & Biases and wants to understand how to log tables with his model data to visualize it better. The user might potentially have a pandas Dataframe he wants to log as a table.
","
How can I log my data as a table in Weights & Biases? Can I use a pandas dataframe?
","
Sure, here are the steps to log a table with W&B:

1. Initialize a W&B Run with `wandb.init()`.
2. Create a `wandb.Table()` object, passing the columns and data parameters, respectively, the names of the columns in your table along with the data.
3. Log the table with `run.log()` as a key-value pair. Provide a name for your table for the key, and pass the object instance of `wandb.Table` as the value.

For example, see the code snippet below:
```python
run = wandb.init(project=""table-test"")
my_table = wandb.Table(columns=[""a"", ""b""], data=[[""a1"", ""b1""], [""a2"", ""b2""]])
run.log({""Table Name"": my_table})
```
You can log a Pandas DataFrame by passing it as the argument to `wandb.Table()`. For more information on supported data types, you can check the `wandb.Table` section in the W&B API Reference Guide."
"
The user is trying to log and visualize tables of data using W&B, most likely for some ML/DL experiments. They've created a 'wandb.Table' object and have passed in their data, but they're unsure of how to log the table and subsequently visualize it in their workspace. 
","
I've created a table with my data using 'wandb.Table'. How can I log this table so I can see it in my workspace?
","
To log the table you've created with `wandb.Table`, you need to use the `run.log()` function. You provide a name for your table (which will be used as a key) and pass the object instance of `wandb.Table` as the value. Here's an example:

```python
run = wandb.init(project=""table-test"")
my_table = wandb.Table(columns=[""a"", ""b""], data=[[""a1"", ""b1""], [""a2"", ""b2""]])
run.log({""Your Table Name"": my_table})

","
I have already created a table object in my run, but I'm unsure on how to log my table, could you guide me?
","
Sure, logging a table in W&B is quite straightforward. After you initialize your run and create your table, you can use the `run.log()` function to log your Table into W&B. The function takes a key-value pair; the key will be the name of your table and the value will be the instance of your `wandb.Table` object. Here's a simple example:

```python
run = wandb.init(project=""table-test"")
my_table = wandb.Table(columns=[""a"", ""b""], data=[[""a1"", ""b1""], [""a2"", ""b2""]])
run.log({""Table Name"": my_table})
```

In this specific example, the table `my_table` is logged under the key `""Table Name""`. The `run.log()` function allows you to specify the name of your table as a key, and associate it with your table object as the value."

The user is working on a project in which they'd like to log data tables for their model training runs using Weights & Biases. They have a good understanding of coding in Python but they have never logged data tables with Weights & Biases.
","
How do I log a data table with Weights & Biases in my project? And where can I see the table after it's logged?
","
To log a data table with Weights & Biases, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize a W&B Run with `wandb.init()`.
2. Create a `wandb.Table()` object instance. Pass the name of the columns in your table along with the data for the `columns` and `data` parameters, respectively.  
3. Log the table with `run.log()` as a key-value pair. The key is the name you provide for your table, and the value is the instance of `wandb.Table` you created.

Here's a Python example:

```python
run = wandb.init(project=""table-test"")
my_table = wandb.Table(columns=[""a"", ""b""], data=[[""a1"", ""b1""], [""a2"", ""b2""]])
run.log({""Table Name"": my_table})
```

Once the table has been logged, you can view it in the W&B App. Navigate to the W&B App and select the name of your Run in your Project workspace. A new panel will be added for each unique table key.

You can log a table with data from a pandas DataFrame using the `wandb.Table()` class provided by W&B.

Here is how you can do it:

1. Start a new W&B Run with `wandb.init()`. 
2. Create a `wandb.Table()` object instance, you can pass a Pandas DataFrame as a parameter. 
3. Then log this table with `run.log()` as a key-value pair. The key here would be the name for your table, and the value would be the object instance of `wandb.Table`.

For example:

```python
run = wandb.init(project=""table-test"")
my_table = wandb.Table(dataframe='your_pandas_dataframe')
run.log({""Table Name"": my_table})
```

To visualize your logged table, go to your W&B project workspace and select the name of your Run. A new panel is added for each unique table you logged.

If you want to compare tables from multiple W&B Runs, just log tables in those Runs and view the results in the project workspace. You can use the table filter, sort, and grouping features to explore and evaluate your model results."

","

Yes, you can definitely tag your runs in Weights & Biases! 

For adding tags to multiple runs, you can use the Project Page. Here's how:

1. In the [runs sidebar](../pages/project-page.md#search-for-runs) of the [Project Page](../pages/project-page.md), click the table icon in the upper-right to expand the sidebar into the full [runs table](runs-table.md).
2. Hover over a run in the table to see a checkbox on the left or look in the header row for a checkbox that will allow you to select all runs.
3. Click the checkbox to enable bulk actions. Select the runs to which you'd like to apply your tag(s).
4. Click the Tag button above the rows of runs.
5. Type a tag you'd like to add and click ""Add"" below the text box to add a new tag. 

If you want to add a tag to a single run, you can do it from the Run Page:

1. In the left sidebar of the [Run Page](../pages/run-page.md), click the top [Overview tab](../pages/run-page.md#overview-tab).
2. Next to ""Tags"" is a gray ➕ button. Click on that plus to add a tag.
3. Type a tag you'd like to add and click ""Add"" below the text box to add a new tag.

You can also control and update tags using [W&B public API](../../../guides/track/public-api-guide.md) for more complex or dynamic tagging scenarios:

```python
run = wandb.Api().run(""{entity}/{project}/{run-id}""})
run.tags.append(""tag1"")  # you can choose tags based on run data here
run.update()
```

"The user is trying to track different versions of models and datasets stored across multiple servers. They are interested in cloud storage options and have their data stored in Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage buckets.
","Hi there! I was curious - is there a way track objects stored in my S3/GCS bucket using W&B? Just metadata details like size, URLs would be great. Also, is there an object limit that I should be aware of?
","
Yes, you can track objects in your S3/GCS bucket using W&B Artifacts. Here's how you can create a reference artifact for an S3 bucket:

```python
import wandb

run = wandb.init()
artifact = wandb.Artifact('mnist', type='dataset')
artifact.add_reference('s3://my-bucket/datasets/mnist')
run.log_artifact(artifact)
```

In the above example, `'mnist'` is the name of the artifact you're creating and `'s3://my-bucket/datasets/mnist'` is the S3 bucket you're referencing. 

This artifact will store metadata about the objects in your bucket, such as their URLs, size, and checksums. 

Please note, by default, W&B imposes a 10,000 object limit when adding an object prefix. You can adjust this limit by specifying `max_objects=` in calls to `add_reference`."
"The user is working with massive datasets stored on an Amazon S3 bucket. They want to track and version their datasets using Weights and Biases (W&B), but they're torn between copying everything over to the W&B servers (which they feel could be a time and space-consuming task) or keeping their data on the S3 bucket while still being able to track it efficiently. The user stumbles on the references feature in W&B and needs some clarification.
","Hey, I stumbled upon artifact references in WandB. Can I track my S3 bucket datasets with this? And how does it even work?
","Yes, you can track your Amazon S3 bucket datasets with W&B Artifacts by using references. Instead of moving your whole data onto W&B, a reference artifact just stores metadata about your files (like URLs, size, and checksums) while the actual data stays in your S3 bucket.

Here's an example of how to track a dataset in your Amazon S3 bucket:

```python
import wandb

run = wandb.init()
artifact = wandb.Artifact('mnist', type='dataset')
artifact.add_reference('s3://my-bucket/datasets/mnist')
run.log_artifact(artifact)
```

In this example, `mnist` is the reference artifact that contains metadata about the dataset stored in `s3://my-bucket/datasets/mnist`

Remember, by default, W&B imposes a 10,000 object limit when adding a reference. You can adjust this limit by specifying `max_objects=` in calls to `add_reference`."
"
The user is working on a machine learning problem where they are using data stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. They want to use W&B to maintain version history of their datasets and models, without moving the data out of their current storage solution. They've heard about W&B Artifacts but they're not sure how to use them with their S3 buckets.
","
How can I use W&B Artifacts to track data stored in my S3 bucket?
","
You can indeed use W&B Artifacts to track data in your S3 bucket. W&B allows you to create reference artifacts that only store metadata about the files, such as URLs, size, and checksums, so your actual data never leaves your storage system.

Here's an example of how you can create a reference to the data in your S3 bucket:

```python
import wandb

run = wandb.init()
artifact = wandb.Artifact('mnist', type='dataset')
artifact.add_reference('s3://my-bucket/datasets/mnist')
run.log_artifact(artifact)
```

In this example, 'mnist' is the name of the artifact, and 'dataset' is its type. The `add_reference` function is used to add a reference (a URL in this case) to the artifact. Finally `log_artifact` is used to log the artifact in W&B.

Remember, W&B imposes a 10,000 object limit when adding an object prefix and you can adjust this limit by specifying `max_objects=` in calls to `add_reference`. Also be aware that this artifact only consists of metadata about the S3 object such as its ETag, size, and version ID.

Now you can use W&B to track your datasets and model versions stored even in AWS S3 bucktes."
"The user has been using W&B for some time and understands the concept of artifacts. Recently, they have begun using Amazon S3 bucket to store large amounts of data and models. They are looking to incorporate this into the W&B ecosystem and start referencing these large files in W&B artifacts. However, they're unsure about whether this is possible and how it can be done due to the size of data involved.
","Hey, I'm managing big files and models on my Amazon S3 bucket. Can I use W&B Artifacts to point to this data rather than storing everything on your servers? If so, how can I do this?
","
Yes, you certainly can. You can use Weights & Biases Artifacts to track references in Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage buckets without modifying your existing storage layout. W&B Artifacts do not impose any restrictions on the underlying cloud storage vendor, so you can easily integrate your existing Amazon S3 setup. 

Here is an example of how to track a dataset stored in an S3 bucket:

```python
import wandb

run = wandb.init()
artifact = wandb.Artifact('mnist', type='dataset')
artifact.add_reference('s3://my-bucket/datasets/mnist')
run.log_artifact(artifact)
```

Using this script, you create an artifact named 'mnist' of type 'dataset' and then add a reference to the dataset stored in the S3 bucket. With `run.log_artifact(artifact)`, you're logging this artifact and its reference to the W&B servers.

Do, however, note that by default, W&B has a limit of 10,000 objects when adding such references. If you plan to reference more than this, you can adjust this limit setting by specifying `max_objects=` in your calls to `add_reference`."
"
The user is working on a Machine Learning project where they utilize Weights & Biases for tracking model pipelines and artifacts. Specifically, they are using AWS S3 cloud storage for hosting their datasets and models. They recently stumbled upon the concept of reference artifacts in W&B. They know that using reference artifacts they can keep track of their data without it leaving their system but how to link their S3 cloud storage with W&B artifacts is a bit unclear to them. 
","
How do I create a reference artifact in Weights & Biases to track my data hosted on an AWS S3 bucket?
","
In Weights & Biases, you can create reference artifacts to track data in your AWS S3 bucket without physically storing it in W&B servers. Here is an example Python code showing how you can do that:

First, start a new run:
```python
import wandb
run = wandb.init()
```
Next, create an artifact and specify it as a reference to your specific S3 bucket location:
```python
artifact = wandb.Artifact('mnist', type='dataset')
artifact.add_reference('s3://my-bucket/datasets/mnist')
```
Finally, log the created artifact:
```python
run.log_artifact(artifact)
```
In this example, 'mnist' is the name of the dataset in your S3 bucket. The created artifact only consists of metadata about the S3 object such as its ETag, size and version ID.

Please note, by default, W&B imposes a 10k object limit when adding an object prefix. You can adjust this limit by specifying `max_objects=` in calls to `add_reference`."

""Hey, can you guide me on how to switch from a scatter plot to a line plot in wandb? And can I also customize the visualization?""
","
Absolutely, you can certainly switch the plot type and customize the visualization. To switch from a scatter plot to a line plot, you'll need to click on **Edit** to change the Vega spec for the chart. In the 'mark' field of the Vega spec, change the value from 'point' to 'line'.

You can also add titles for your plot, legend, x-axis and y-axis by setting the ""title"" for each field in the Vega spec. Furthermore, if you find any unused fields such as the ""size"" field, you can remove them.

Finally, after making these changes, to save this as a preset for future use in this project, simply click on **Save as** at the top of the page.
